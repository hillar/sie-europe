> AData Participant who operates one or morerecursive domain name system (RDNS) servers will install SIE-Europe’sopen-source software-based Passive DNS sensors on or nearby each such server. This can be done by adding a passive networktap to the name server, or by adding a “span port” on the name server’s upstream Ethernet switch, or by installing the Passive DNS sensor software directly on the name server itself, or by using the open source dnstapprotocol to reach a nearby telemetry collection server.
